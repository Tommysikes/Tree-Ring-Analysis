# Tree Ring Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the Tree Ring Analysis project, where we embark on a journey to uncover the growth patterns and climate impact on trees through the analysis of 60 years' worth of tree ring data. This project showcases the utilization of advanced data analysis techniques and powerful libraries to extract meaningful insights from ecological data.

## Duration

- Duration: May 2022 - Aug 2022
- Institution: Associated with Lambton College

## Project Description

In this project, I delved into the intricate world of tree ring data to unravel the story hidden within. By employing state-of-the-art Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based clustering techniques, I revealed the nuanced growth patterns of trees and highlighted the profound impact of climate on their growth trajectories.

## Data Integrity and Cleaning

- Data accuracy and reliability were paramount. To achieve this, I leveraged the Pandas and NumPy libraries to meticulously clean the data, ensuring its integrity.
- The use of Pandas and NumPy facilitated data cleaning and outlier detection, minimizing inaccuracies and ensuring the dataset's quality.

## Unveiling Recurring Patterns

- To gain deeper insights, the STUMPY library was a game-changer. This tool enabled the identification of recurring patterns within the data.
- By harnessing the power of STUMPY, I shed light on the distinct growth trajectories of trees across diverse environmental conditions.

## Intuitive Visualization

- Visualizing complex data was made effortless using Streamlit, a dynamic web application framework.
- I seamlessly integrated Streamlit to create an interactive platform that allowed researchers to explore and comprehend intricate growth dynamics.

## Contribution to Ecological Understanding

The strategic implementation of cutting-edge libraries and tools, coupled with my expertise, facilitated the extraction of profound insights from tree ring data. This analysis significantly contributes to the understanding of ecological changes and growth patterns over time.

## Libraries and Tools

- Pandas and NumPy: Data cleaning and integrity maintenance.
- STUMPY: Identifying recurring patterns for deeper insights.
